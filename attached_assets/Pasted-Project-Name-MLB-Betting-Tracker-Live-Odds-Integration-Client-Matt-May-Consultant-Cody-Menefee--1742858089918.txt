Project Name: MLB Betting Tracker – Live Odds Integration
Client: Matt May
Consultant: Cody Menefee (Modern Strategy, LLC)
Date: March 24, 2025
Stage: Contract 2 – API Automation Upgrade
API Provider: The Odds API

🎯 Objective
Expand the current POC to include real-time game and odds data, removing the need for manual game uploads. This will allow GPT to generate accurate, up-to-date betting recommendations each day, fully automated.

🔧 Key Features
1. Odds API Integration
Connect to The Odds API (v4) to pull:

Today’s MLB games

Team matchups

Start times

Moneyline odds (U.S. sportsbooks: FanDuel, DraftKings, etc.)

Use the /v4/sports/baseball_mlb/odds/ endpoint

Region: us, Market: h2h (head-to-head)

2. Automated Daily Fetch
System should auto-fetch odds each day at a set time (e.g. 7 AM ET)

Fallback logic if API rate limits or downtime occur

Parse and format the game data for GPT prompts

3. Prompt Integration
Inject fetched game data into the ChatGPT prompt to guide bet recommendation generation

Continue to produce structured JSON output as in the POC

4. Google Sheet Logging
Maintain existing logging structure in the Google Sheet

Ensure odds from API appear alongside each generated bet

📂 Data Flow
Scheduler or Manual Trigger → Fetch games from The Odds API

Parse API Response → Format into game objects for GPT prompt

Call ChatGPT → Generate structured recommendations (with embedded odds)

Log Output → Google Sheet as individual entries

Frontend → Display daily picks + odds

🧪 Test Case Example
API Response Sample:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "teams": ["Yankees", "Red Sox"],
  "commence_time": "2025-03-24T17:10:00Z",
  "bookmakers": [{
    "title": "DraftKings",
    "markets": [{
      "outcomes": [
        {"name": "Yankees", "price": -110},
        {"name": "Red Sox", "price": +100}
      ]
    }]
  }]
}
GPT Prompt Fragment:

"Today's matchup is Yankees vs. Red Sox. Odds from DraftKings: Yankees -110, Red Sox +100. Please generate a betting recommendation in structured JSON format..."

📝 Assumptions
The client will provide their API key for The Odds API OR use temporary shared credentials via Modern Strategy

Usage will remain under free tier limits initially (500 requests/month)

GPT will still "reason" based on odds but will not have insider knowledge on injuries, trends, etc. unless explicitly included

🚧 Out of Scope
Injuries, team trends, weather (can be added in later contracts with new APIs)

Frontend redesign (available as a separate add-on)

Multi-league support (focus is on MLB preseason only for now)

📅 Timeline & Cost
Estimated Time: 2–3 days
Cost: $150 fixed-price contract on Upwork

✅ Deliverables
Live API integration with The Odds API

Fully automated daily GPT prompt using real data

Updated codebase

Working deployment (Replit or hosted option)

Updated README.md with new flow

Optional short walkthrough video
